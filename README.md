# UT-ECE-EPS-Fall2024


This repository contains my solutions for four computer assignments in Engineering Probability and Statistics.

## CA0: Intro to NumPy & Bayes Classifier
**Language:** Python
**Topics:** Introduction to NumPy, simulating the "Majority Vote" problem, and building a Naive Bayes spam email classifier from scratch. Focuses on data preprocessing and applying Bayes' Theorem.

## CA1: Statistical Distributions & Transformations
**Language:** R
**Topics:** Exploring various distributions (Geometric, Exponential, Binomial, Normal), the St. Petersburg Paradox, and transforming random variables (e.g., converting a Uniform distribution to an Exponential or Normal using log and Box-Muller transformations).

## CA2: Bayesian Estimation & Correlation
**Language:** Python
**Topics:** Simulating a queue system to analyze joint distributions and correlation. Using Bayesian estimation with a Beta prior to estimate the probability of a coin flip. Analyzing real energy data to calculate correlations and understand spurious relationships.

## CA3: Central Limit Theorem (CLT) & Estimation
**Language:** Python
**Topics:** Empirically demonstrating the Central Limit Theorem by sampling from different distributions. Applying Mean Squared Error (MSE) to find optimal parameters for linear regression and a data center. Using the Normal distribution to approximate the Binomial distribution.
